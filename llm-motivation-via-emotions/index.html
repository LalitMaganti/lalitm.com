      <p>One of my biggest weaknesses as a software engineer is procrastination
when facing a new project. When the scope is unclear, I have a tendency to
wait until I feel I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;felt out&rdquo; the problem to start doing anything.
I know I&rsquo;ll feel better and work much faster when I get &ldquo;stuck in&rdquo; but
I still struggle with that first step, overcoming the &ldquo;activation energy&rdquo;
required to engage with the details.</p>
<p>LLMs have been a game-changer for me in this respect: I can just throw a couple
of sentences at them with the shape of the problem. This leads to one of two
outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The LLM comes up with a good solution, usually in a slightly different
way than what I was thinking. I realize &ldquo;oh wow the solution is much
simpler than I thought&rdquo;. Straight away I start thinking about the consequences
of implementing and improving what the LLM suggested.</li>
<li>The LLM comes up with a solution that I intuitively recognize as &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;.
My immediate reaction is frustration (&ldquo;How could it get it so wrong&rdquo;) which leads me
to go back and forth with the model, explaining to it why its solution
could not <em>possibly</em> work. But in the process of arguing with the model, my
brain is churning away and generating variations or different
approaches that <em>could</em> work. After a while, even if the AI is still on the wrong
track, the debate will trigger a moment of inspiration where suddenly the solution will
come to me. I&rsquo;ll excitedly start up a new conversation and start working through
it with the model.</li>
</ol>
<p>The key is the emotional reaction I have immediately to the LLM&rsquo;s response, either
<strong>excitement or frustration</strong>. By harnessing this immediate feedback loop, I
get my brain out of its passive, procrastination mode. It&rsquo;s almost like a jolt:
either I&rsquo;m thrilled because it&rsquo;s simpler than I thought, or I&rsquo;m spurred to action
by the urge to correct a perceived &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; answer. This forces me to engage with
the problem in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, this experience is very similar to talking through a problem with
another engineer: the advantage of LLMs is that it&rsquo;s available 24/7 and I never have to work
about my problem being &ldquo;too insignificant&rdquo; to bother someone with.
The simple act of articulating my thoughts and hearing a response seems sufficient,
regardless of the response&rsquo;s quality.</p>
<p>So next time you&rsquo;re procrastinating a problem don&rsquo;t wait around for inspiration. Outsource
the first step. Throw the problem at an LLM and see what happens. Whether excitement or
frustration, by channeling that emotion you can solve your problem faster.</p>
