facing a new project. When the scope is unclear, I have a tendency to wait until
I feel I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;felt out&rdquo; the problem to start doing anything. I know I&rsquo;ll feel
better and work much faster when I get &ldquo;stuck in&rdquo; but I still struggle with that
first step, overcoming the &ldquo;activation energy&rdquo; required to engage with the
details.
LLMs have been a game-changer for me in this respect: I can just throw a couple
of sentences at them with the shape of the problem. This leads to one of two
outcomes:

The LLM comes up with a good solution, usually in a slightly different way
than what I was thinking. I realize &ldquo;oh wow the solution is much simpler than
I thought&rdquo;. Straight away I start thinking about the consequences of
implementing and improving what the LLM suggested.
The LLM comes up with a solution that I intuitively recognize as &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;. My
immediate reaction is frustration (&ldquo;How could it get it so wrong&rdquo;) which
leads me to go back and forth with the model, explaining to it why its
solution could not possibly work. But in the process of arguing with the
model, my brain is churning away and generating variations or different
approaches that could work. After a while, even if the AI is still on the
wrong track, the debate will trigger a moment of inspiration where suddenly
the solution will come to me. I&rsquo;ll excitedly start up a new conversation and
start working through it with the model.

The key is the emotional reaction I have immediately to the LLM&rsquo;s response,
either excitement or frustration. By harnessing this immediate feedback
loop, I get my brain out of its passive, procrastination mode. It&rsquo;s almost like
a jolt: either I&rsquo;m thrilled because it&rsquo;s simpler than I thought, or I&rsquo;m spurred
to action by the urge to correct a perceived &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; answer. This forces me to
engage with the problem in a meaningful way."><meta name=author content="Lalit Maganti"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=/main.min.css><style>article{font-size:.9375rem!important;line-height:1.6!important}article header h1,article>header>h1,article>h1{font-size:1rem!important;line-height:1.6!important;font-weight:700!important}article h1 a{font-weight:700!important}main.prose>*:first-child,main.prose>*:first-child>*:first-child{margin-top:0!important}main{padding-top:1rem!important}html.dark{background-color:#282828}body{&::before { background-color:rgb(40,40,40); }}</style><link rel=preload as=image href=/theme.png><link rel=preload as=image href=/github.svg><link rel=preload as=image href=/linkedin.svg><link rel=preload as=image href=/rss.svg><script defer src=/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><link rel=icon href=/favicon.ico><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=/apple-touch-icon.png><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.152.1"><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-CPF1NN7N28"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-CPF1NN7N28")}</script><meta itemprop=name content="Harnessing Frustration: Using LLMs to Overcome Activation Energy"><meta itemprop=description content="One of my biggest weaknesses as a software engineer is procrastination when facing a new project.

problem with another engineer: the advantage of LLMs is that it&rsquo;s available 24/7

someone with. The simple act of articulating my thoughts and hearing a response
seems sufficient, regardless of the response&rsquo;s quality.</p><p>So next time you&rsquo;re procrastinating a problem don&rsquo;t wait around for inspiration.
Outsource the first step. Throw the problem at an LLM and see what happens.
Whether excitement or frustration, by channeling that emotion you can solve your
problem faster.</p></section><div class="mt-8 border-t border-black/[20%] pt-6 dark:border-white/[20%]"><p class="text-sm opacity-60"><em>If you enjoyed this post, you can <a href=/page/about/#subscribe>subscribe</a> to my weekly roundup of recent posts, or follow via <a href=/index.xml>RSS</a>.</em></p></div><nav class="mt-12 flex overflow-hidden rounded-xl bg-black/[3%] text-lg leading-[1.2]! *:flex *:w-1/2 *:items-center *:p-5 *:font-medium *:no-underline dark:bg-white/[8%] [&>*:hover]:bg-black/[2%] dark:[&>*:hover]:bg-white/[3%]"><a class="ltr:pr-3 rtl:pl-3" href=/writing-tools-for-claude-code/><span class="ltr:mr-1.5 rtl:ml-1.5">←</span><span>What Makes a Good Tool for Claude Code</span></a><a class="justify-end pl-3 ltr:ml-auto rtl:mr-auto" href=/hw-encoding-raspi/><span>V4L2 and Hardware Encoding on the Raspberry Pi</span><span class="ltr:ml-1.5 rtl:mr-1.5">→</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class="mx-auto flex h-[4.5rem] max-w-(--w) items-center px-8 text-xs tracking-wider uppercase opacity-60"><div class=mr-auto>&copy;2025
