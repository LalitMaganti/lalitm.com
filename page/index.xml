&lt;a href="https://perfetto.dev"&gt;Perfetto&lt;/a&gt;, an open source suite of tools for performance
tracing and analysis. I&amp;rsquo;ve joined Perfetto as a founding engineer in 2017 and
have been part of the project ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfetto is the default tracing system for Android and Chrome, and is now used
by companies like Meta and Microsoft, as well as in open source projects
like QEMU, Mesa and the Linux kernel. My work focuses on trace analysis
tools — particularly the PerfettoSQL language and its query engine — and championing
the use of Perfetto by open source projects and the industry more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
