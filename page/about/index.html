Perfetto, an open source suite of tools for performance
tracing and analysis. I joined Perfetto as a founding engineer in 2017 and
have been part of the project ever since.
Perfetto is the default tracing system for Android and Chrome, and is now used
by companies like Meta and Microsoft, as well as in open source projects
like QEMU, Mesa and the Linux kernel. My work focuses on trace analysis
tools — particularly the PerfettoSQL language and its query engine — and championing
the use of Perfetto by open source projects and the industry more broadly.
I&rsquo;m passionate about performance and open-source and especially the intersection
of those two domains. I&rsquo;m also generally interested in AI/LLMs and how they are
changing the software engineering industry.
Before Google, in my spare time, I contributed to Android custom ROMs (e.g. CyanogenMod,
OmniROM) and built open source Android applications, the most successful being an IRC
client called HoloIRC."><meta name=author content="Lalit Maganti"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://lalitm.com/main.min.css><link rel=preload as=image href=https://lalitm.com/theme.png><link rel=preload as=image href=https://lalitm.com/github.svg><link rel=preload as=image href=https://lalitm.com/linkedin.svg><link rel=preload as=image href=https://lalitm.com/bluesky.svg><link rel=preload as=image href=https://lalitm.com/rss.svg><script defer src=https://lalitm.com/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><link rel=icon href=https://lalitm.com/favicon.ico><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://lalitm.com/apple-touch-icon.png><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.152.2"><link rel=preconnect href=https://www.googletagmanager.com crossorigin><link rel=dns-prefetch href=https://www.google-analytics.com><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-CPF1NN7N28"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-CPF1NN7N28",{anonymize_ip:!0,cookie_flags:"SameSite=None;Secure"})</script><meta itemprop=name content="About"><meta itemprop=description content="I’m a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Google working on Perfetto, an open source suite of tools for performance tracing and analysis.
