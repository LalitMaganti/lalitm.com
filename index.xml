      <description>TLDR: Explain how the V4L2 M2M API works through the use-case of implementing hardware video encoding on the Raspberry Pi. This knowledge is generally useful as V4L2 is the de-facto generic API for hardware decoding and encoding on Linux.
Background My journey started at this video on the excellent Craft Computing YouTube channel which showed how to setup TinyPilot, a Python app for KVM over IP which runs on a Raspberry Pi.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer working at Google on Perfetto, the next generation performance tracing framework used by Chrome and Android. My main work is with the trace processor, a C++ library that ingests traces and exposes an SQL interface for querying events.
In my spare time, I tinker with projects from a variety of software engineering domains and write endless (largely unreleased) personal projects. I also play copious amounts of chess and have a long term goal of earning a title.</description>
